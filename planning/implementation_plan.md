# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Setup & Core Logic

**Goal:** Establish the foundational web application structure, implement the core BAC calculation logic, and create a basic user interface for input and output.

**Architecture:**
- Backend: Python (Flask framework)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, basic JavaScript
- Calculation: Widmark formula

**Key Steps:**
1. Set up project directories and planning files.
2. Create the main HTML page (`index.html`) with input fields (weight, gender, alcohol consumed, time).
3. Create basic CSS (`style.css`) for layout and aesthetics.
4. Implement the BAC calculation function in Python.
5. Set up a Flask application (`app.py`).
6. Create Flask routes to serve the HTML page and handle form submissions.
7. Display the calculated BAC result on the page.

## Phase 2: UI/UX Enhancements

**Goal:** Improve the visual appeal and user experience of the application.

**Key Steps:**
1. Refine CSS for a modern, beautiful, and responsive design.
2. Potentially introduce interactive elements like sliders or visual aids.
3. Use JavaScript (possibly with AJAX/Fetch) to update the BAC result dynamically without a full page reload.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Deployment

**Goal:** Add optional features and prepare the application for easy deployment.

**Key Steps:**
1. (Optional) Implement features like user profiles or detailed drink selection.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies.
3. Create a simple script (e.g., `run.sh`) or clear instructions for a one-command launch.
